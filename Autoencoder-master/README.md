# Autoencoder
MATLAB implementation of an autoencoder.

More to come soon, including an example script and sample output.

Note that this code makes use of Mark Schmidt's [minFunc package](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software) which I have found to be vastly superior to Matlab's fminunc (which is, nevertheless, supported in the code). 

**EDIT 02/09/16** I have now included a simple stochastic gradient descent routine in the repo. It's slower than Mark Schmidt's deterministic routines for the problems I work on, but it might be of some use for larger problems in the future.
